Example application to demonstrate the core Backbone.js abstractions.
This application is based on a
[similar application](https://github.com/bkeepers/monologue) by
[Brandon Keepers](http://opensoul.org/) for his
[magnificent presentation](http://opensoul.org/blog/archives/2012/05/16/the-plight-of-pinocchio/)
on JavaScript testing and design patterns.

[Here's](http://monologue-js.herokuapp.com/) the application up and
running. The blog post is still not finished, but there is
[a WIP](https://github.com/kjbekkelund/writings/blob/master/understanding-backbone.md)
on Github.
